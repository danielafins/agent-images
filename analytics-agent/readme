Build your own analytics agent image

Download the latest agent bundle from https://download.appdynamics.com/download/
Make a note of sha256 checksum value and the full version of the agent (e.g. 4.5.9.2096)
Run ./build.sh passing the version and the checksum. The checksum can be left blank to avoid validation. It is a best practice to validate the package integrity.

An example yaml spec is provided to demonstrate how to deploy the analytics agent as a sidecar to an application instrumented with the AppDynamics java agent.
