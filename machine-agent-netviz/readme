Build your own image of the machine agent with netviz

Download the latest agent bundle from https://download.appdynamics.com/download/
Make a note of sha256 checksum value and the full version of the agent (e.g. 4.5.9.2096)
Run ./build.sh passing the version and the checksum. The checksum can be left blank to avoid validation. It is a best practice to validate the package integrity.

Create a secret to hold appdynamics controller access key
kubectl create secret generic appd-secret --from-literal=appd-key=<controller-access-key>

Populate the configMap ma-config.yaml with values specific to your environment. Make sure you provide all the required values.
Update the spec machine-agent.yaml with the reference to the newly built image

Create a service account for deployment. In the attached spec of the machine agent with netviz, it is appd-infra-sa.
The account needs to be privileged and have read-only access to cluster entities

#deploy daemon set
kubectl create -f machine-agent.yaml


Example account creation in OpenShift

#create a new project or use an existing one
oc new-project ma

#create a service account for the daemon set deployment
oc create sa ma

#make the account privileged, which is necessary for accessing docker api and host root
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z ma

#assign account to the cluster-reader role to be able to read pod metadata
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader -z ma
